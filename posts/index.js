      "\n## How this blog?\n\nThis blog is a static git based blog, meaning there is no database, no serverside script, and no dependencies.\nThe only requirement for this site is the abillity to server some files.\n\nThis keeps the blog clean, simple and secure when it is being served to the web.\n\nAlso being gitbased i, and my readers, have revisions on all my changes, since i host on github.\n\n# That sounds dum, dont you need dynamic things?\n\nI have those things, contrary to fx. wordpress that generates them on page-request i have all the options precompiled as static files.\n\nThis gives me the benefit of fast pageloads, and few bottlenecks, all i do is serve files.\n\n# But surely you cannot do that with all content?\n\nTrue, my intention is that things that require too much generation or cannot be precompiled are handled in javascript on the client.\nThe data for these features will come from 3'rd party services. \n\nFor a blog like this i doubt i will have much of said things however.\nFor comments, and social interactions can all be handled bu thirdparty services that take the featues out of my hands to maintain.\n\n# Sounds great, what is the catch?\n\nThe 'catch' is that i need to run a generator everytime i do changes, and then move the generated files onto the hosting webserver.\n\nThere are a number of libraries that help facilitate this today however.\n\nProblably the biggest catch here is that it makes it hard for the none tecknically inclined person to maintain a blog like this.\n\nA proper application could facilitate fixing this however.\nIt would be a very neat replacement for the horror that is wordpress.\nIn fact \"someone should\" make that, i see a huge earning potential here if implemented right.\nThink \"3'rd party server subscribtions\".\n\n## So specificly, how did you make this?\n\nI have choosen to use 'next-static' as my blog setup for now.\nBasically i write my articles in markup -which is a generic document format- and then i run a nodejs generator which converts it into html for me.\nNext-static then publish directly to github pages, on demand, which is what i am using currently.\n\nDoing that means all i have to do is some DNS magic and blog.sebb.dk is a reality.\n\nThis means that setup is really easy from a teckincal perspective. \n\nThe keypoint here is that all my articles are in markup, so migration will always be super easy if i decide to try something else.\n\n# final thoughts\nI am still trying out this setup, and changes are bound to happen but i feel very positive towards thi setup/stack.",

      '\n## Music and programming\n\nWell, music and any concentration task problably, but my main experience source is from programming, so to keep potential bias i will speak about it in programming and writing context.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nConcentration is best achieved if you can enter a state of trance, this trance can be enhanced, or broken, with the right music.\n\nGenerelly speaking music without vocals and too much variation will enhance your trance, and music that rips you out of your task by making you sing along or change your mood abrubtly will ruin your concentration.\n\n# On concentration\n\nSlightly boring, but in order to make any sort of theories about this first we must consolidate the terms we use.\nConcentration, or concentrating, is the act of focusing on a single subject and removing unwanted subjects/cargo on your brain-train so you can go faster\n\nSome examples of this is could be painting/drawing, data entry, writing, solving math problems, and programming which is a combination of some of the former examples.\nProgramming involving problem solving, writing, data-entry, and a plethora of other tasks.\n\nOfcause this is just based on personal experience.\nIf you think i am wrong, then let me know, it is a huge point for theories alter in the article.\n\n# On music\n\nThis should be self evident what it is, otherwise go and look up music here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n\nBut generelly we are just refering to any sort of noise that a any human would refer to as plesant.\n\n## Initiating concentration\n\nSince a important part of concentration having as few irellevant thoughts as possible, first we need to clear the stage-AKA you mind.\n\nI have always used music to control my mood, heck i have used it to change other peoples moods as well, think parties.\nIt is one of magic things about music, and it is also one of the reasons it enhances concentration in my experience.\n\nThe point here being that it can\' change the subjects of your thoughts, and thus how much you have in your head at any one given time.\nThus it frees up valuable brain-power that can now be used to concentrate.\n\nMy experience on the matter is that if i feel like crap, i can use upbeat or buildup music to get back in the game and feel like a champ.\nHeck, ever listener to "2 steps from hell" while on the crapper?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRLdhFVzqt4\n\nThe most epic shits ever given are guaranteed!\n\nTalking to fellow developers the exact music used for this purpose seems specific to the person.\nGenerally speaking, just play play some of that music you usually listen to when you are hyped.\nEven if i do not feel like it, playing this kind of music will usually lift my mood a lot.\n\n\n## Maintaining conentration\n\nMaintaining concentration and initiating concentration require different music in my experience.\nThe point being that once you are concentrating you want to maintain you focus, and not change it.\n\nTo this effect monotone music is the best, my personal preference includes rythmic beats and smooth jazz.\nThe most effective to me has always been music that does not draw focus to vocals or high-notes etc.\nThis is also the experience of fellow developers i have talked to.\n\nIn relation to drawing which i occasionally do, i find that similary using emotional music to capture a feel\' you want you expression to have works well.\nImplementing, or drawing details i prefer more monoton music again, focusing on the individual lines, color variations, and generelt refinement is hard if you keep getting distracted.\n\nThe feel\' of drawing concentration/focus/trance is also very similar to both programmign and writing.\nIf you like drawing i cannot recommend the book "Drawing with the right side of the brain" enough.\nI goes over how to improve you drawing related concentration tremendously.\n\n# The effects of interuptions\n\nSomething which i think most people can relate to are the effects of concentration interuptions.\n\nGetting interupted by a curious collegue, your phone, etc, i usually get dazed briefly leaving my unable to process this event\' for a moment.\nThe reason here ofcause is that it takes a moment to load in the relevant data to react.\n\nThis new data then overrides all the data oyu filled into your concentration/focus, and thus is takes a lot of time to get back.\nThe bigger the interuption the longer the time it will usually take to get back.\nBigger here meaning you have to load more data into your focus to react appropriatly.\n\n# Recovering from interuptions\n\nBeing a programmer i get interupted a lot by collegues that need my attention momentarely.\nLoading in all the data means i have to spen a lot of time reloading my focus with my current task afterwards.\n\nSome things i have found to help are:\n\n* Use music as a tool to get back in if you get stressed by the interuption (time pressure, the interuption was unimportant, etc)\n* Re-establish your mental model or subject on a piece of paper.\n* Start over, go for a walk think about it and come back.\n\n# final thoughts\n\nI could end with a conclusion here, but i already did that in the TL;DR\nThis articled made me think i need to investigate this subject more.\n\nSo i will probalbly get back to this at some point, but this is my current view on concentration and programming.\n\nFor now i will get back to my programming.\n\n\n',
