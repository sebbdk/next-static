## Music and programming

Well, music and any concentration task problably, but my main experience source is from programming, so to keep potential bias i will speak about it in programming and writing context.

# TL;DR

Concentration is best achieved if you can enter a state of trance, this trance can be enhanced, or broken, with the right music.

Generelly speaking music without vocals and too much variation will enhance your trance, and music that rips you out of your task by making you sing along or change your mood abrubtly will ruin your concentration.

# On concentration

Slightly boring, but in order to make any sort of theories about this first we must consolidate the terms we use.
Concentration, or concentrating, is the act of focusing on a single subject and removing unwanted subjects/cargo on your brain-train so you can go faster

Some examples of this is could be painting/drawing, data entry, writing, solving math problems, and programming which is a combination of some of the former examples.
Programming involving problem solving, writing, data-entry, and a plethora of other tasks.

Ofcause this is just based on personal experience.
If you think i am wrong, then let me know, it is a huge point for theories alter in the article.

# On music

This should be self evident what it is, otherwise go and look up music here:

But generelly we are just refering to any sort of noise that a any human would refer to as plesant.

## Initiating concentration

Since a important part of concentration having as few irellevant thoughts as possible, first we need to clear the stage-AKA you mind.

I have always used music to control my mood, heck i have used it to change other peoples moods as well, think parties.
It is one of magic things about music, and it is also one of the reasons it enhances concentration in my experience.

The point here being that it can' change the subjects of your thoughts, and thus how much you have in your head at any one given time.
Thus it frees up valuable brain-power that can now be used to concentrate.

My experience on the matter is that if i feel like crap, i can use upbeat or buildup music to get back in the game and feel like a champ.
Heck, ever listener to "2 steps from hell" while on the crapper?

The most epic shits ever given are guaranteed!

Talking to fellow developers the exact music used for this purpose seems specific to the person.
Generally speaking, just play play some of that music you usually listen to when you are hyped.
Even if i do not feel like it, playing this kind of music will usually lift my mood a lot.


## Maintaining conentration

Maintaining concentration and initiating concentration require different music in my experience.
The point being that once you are concentrating you want to maintain you focus, and not change it.

To this effect monotone music is the best, my personal preference includes rythmic beats and smooth jazz.
The most effective to me has always been music that does not draw focus to vocals or high-notes etc.
This is also the experience of fellow developers i have talked to.

In relation to drawing which i occasionally do, i find that similary using emotional music to capture a feel' you want you expression to have works well.
Implementing, or drawing details i prefer more monoton music again, focusing on the individual lines, color variations, and generelt refinement is hard if you keep getting distracted.

The feel' of drawing concentration/focus/trance is also very similar to both programmign and writing.
If you like drawing i cannot recommend the book "Drawing with the right side of the brain" enough.
I goes over how to improve you drawing related concentration tremendously.

# The effects of interuptions

Something which i think most people can relate to are the effects of concentration interuptions.

Getting interupted by a curious collegue, your phone, etc, i usually get dazed briefly leaving my unable to process this event' for a moment.
The reason here ofcause is that it takes a moment to load in the relevant data to react.

This new data then overrides all the data oyu filled into your concentration/focus, and thus is takes a lot of time to get back.
The bigger the interuption the longer the time it will usually take to get back.
Bigger here meaning you have to load more data into your focus to react appropriatly.

# Recovering from interuptions

Being a programmer i get interupted a lot by collegues that need my attention momentarely.
Loading in all the data means i have to spen a lot of time reloading my focus with my current task afterwards.

Some things i have found to help are:

* Use music as a tool to get back in if you get stressed by the interuption (time pressure, the interuption was unimportant, etc)
* Re-establish your mental model or subject on a piece of paper.
* Start over, go for a walk think about it and come back.

# final thoughts

I could end with a conclusion here, but i already did that in the TL;DR
This articled made me think i need to investigate this subject more.

So i will probalbly get back to this at some point, but this is my current view on concentration and programming.

For now i will get back to my programming.
